                        The chicken is a domesticated red junglefowl species that is originally from Southeast Asia.
                        They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl. Rooster and cock are
                        terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been
                        castrated is a capon.

                    <p>
                        Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. In prehistoric times, humankind hunted aurochs
                        and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred
                        specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat.

                        Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt,
                        accompanied by a variety of ingredients, such as seafood—often raw—and vegetables. Styles of
                        sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also
                        referred to as shari, or sumeshi.
